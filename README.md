# React Native Mobile App

This is a mobile application built using **React Native** and follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The app demonstrates skills in app development, API management, handling multiple screens, and executing background tasks effectively.  

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Metro is the JavaScript bundler used by React Native. To start Metro, open a terminal at the root of your project directory and run:

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
